# EE133.github.io

For EE133 assignments, we hope that each student will maintain a fork of this repository.

To create the initial fork, click on the button on the top right corner of the screen, between the star and watch buttons.

# Accessing labs
Each of the labs will be posted in a finalized form on the central github branch. 
If this occurs after you have created your fork, GitHub will prompt you to fetch the upstream files as shown in the picture below. Doing so will allow you to obtain the most recent copies of each of the labs.

# Turning in your labs

Lab reports are expected to be in the form of a latex document, but we will support other forms of supplementary submissions such as images which would not format correctly or code files used in analyzing your data. For each lab, collect all necessary files in a folder named 'Lab_X' where X is the lab number and leave them on your personal fork.
